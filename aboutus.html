    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Over the period of the last 11 years, YOU have taken Computer Zone from a simple business idea to a revolution in
        the heart of Pakistan’s Information Technology market. The<br>
        idea behind the development of Computer Zone was never about creating a retailer with good prices; but to give
        birth to a place where people could be served as a part of the<br>
        family. Where they could actually feel the touch of Information Technology’s application in the way they are
        dealt with. The world has moved to the next generation of business<br>
        relationships; and we are proud to be the first in Pakistan’s Information Technology market to accept that “Yes,
        YOU are important!” With around 1,000% growth rate, we are<br>
        proud and extremely happy to quote that Computer Zone has a family of more then a million online family members
        and more than 200,000 (and growing) customer’s offline; in<br>
        comparison to a total of 10 customers 11 years ago. The world is changing and Computer Zone happily accepts that
        the customers of today are more tech savvy and demand<br>
        value for their money. We believe that change is the only thing constant and in order to deliver to you the
        value you deserve, we are always in the process of evolving to the next<br>
        best level.</p>
    <p>The success of Computer Zone is not a magical coincidence but a result of experienced professionals listening to
        and implementing every suggestion that YOU gifted us with<br>
        over the past 11 years. The world has revolutionized and it’s time to move from those close gullied and air
        tight markets to a system of automation where you do not need to run<br>
        after sales people asking for product specification and quotations. Have a nice sip of coffee, stretch your legs
        and go through the updated, complete and vast range of products<br>
        awaiting your royal presence by a few clicks. Even if you are not comfortable at dealing with an online market
        and need a more personal touch and suggestion to things; come<br>
        visit Computer Zone. 11 years ago people didn’t have online markets; and Computer Zone respects your demand for
        one to one communication and anxiously awaits your<br>
        presence</p>
    <p>There might still be a lot of things that you could want to know about Computer Zone. Simply Sign up, feel free,
        and don’t be shy. We never tell our customers to hush away<br>
        because there are others to deal with or we already met our daily sales quota. So, welcome to Computer Zone; and
        don’t you worry because whether you are a corporate client<br>
        or an individual customer; we are family now. Welcome to the Information Technology’s Revolution in Pakistan!
